A collection of beautiful, customizable Gutenberg blocks, page layouts and sections. An extention to the already exhaustive Atomic Blocks Plugin.

== Description ==

Atomic Blocks is a collection of page building blocks for the new [Gutenberg](https://atomicblocks.com/beginners-guide-gutenberg/?utm_source=WP.org%20Description%20Gberg%20Link&utm_campaign=wporg_desc_gberg_link) block editor. Building pages with the block editor and Atomic Blocks gives you more control to quickly create and launch any kind of site you want!

Installing the customizable Atomic Block plugin adds a collection of beautiful, site-building blocks to help you customize page layouts, increase engagement, and get results for your business. Atomic Blocks provides everything from customizable buttons, to beautifully-designed page sections and full-page layout designs via the Section & Layout block.

Along with the content blocks you'll find in Atomic Blocks, we're also publishing helpful articles and tutorials to help you get started with Gutenberg.
